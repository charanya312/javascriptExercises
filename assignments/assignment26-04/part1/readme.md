Task1:
console.log(mysteryVariable); // ReferenceError!
mysteryVariable = 10;
console.log(mysteryVariable);

function revealMystery() {
  console.log("Inside revealMystery:", mysteryVariable);
  let mysteryVariable = 20;
  console.log("Inside revealMystery (after declaration):", mysteryVariable);
}

revealMystery();
console.log("After revealMystery:" mysteryVariable);
This gives a reference error :cannot access "mystery variable" before declaration.
let and const are hoisted, but not initialized. They're in a temporal dead zone (TDZ) from the start of the block until the declaration is executed.
Task2:
hoisting is js means moving function or variable to top of their scope during compilation before execution only declaration not initilization.
var is function-scoped and is initialized to undefined when hoisted. This is why you can access it before its declaration.

let and const are block-scoped and not initialized at the time of hoisting. Accessing them before their declaration throws a ReferenceError because they live in the TDZ.
